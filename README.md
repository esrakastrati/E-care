<h2> React Native </h2> 
React Native is a JavaScript framework for writing real, natively rendering mobile applications for iOS and Android. It’s based on React, Facebook’s JavaScript library for building user interfaces, but instead of targeting the browser, it targets mobile platforms. In other words: web developers can now write mobile applications that look and feel truly native to all from the comfort of a JavaScript library that we already know. React Native makes it easy to simultaneously develop for both Android and iOS.

<h2> Expo Client </h2>
Expo is a toolkit that wraps around React Native projects to remove dependency on Xcode/Android SDK
It allows for quick testing and pre-release deployment
Additional UI components, access to more device functionality
Push notifications are easy to deploy



<h2> GraphQL </h2>
GraphQL is an open-source data query and manipulation language for APIs, and a runtime for fulfilling queries with existing data. GraphQL was developed internally by Facebook in 2012 before being publicly released in 2015.

It provides an efficient, powerful and flexible approach to developing web APIs, and has been compared and contrasted with other web service architectures. It allows clients to define the structure of the data required, and exactly the same structure of the data is returned from the server, therefore preventing excessively large amounts of data from being returned

A graph database is a database that uses graph structures for semantic queries with nodes, edges and properties to represent and store data. A key concept of the system is the graph (or edge or relationship), which directly relates data items in the store a collection of nodes of data and edges representing the relationships between the nodes. The relationships allow data in the store to be linked together directly, and in many cases retrieved with one operation. Graph databases hold the relationships between data as a priority. Querying relationships within a graph database is fast because they are perpetually stored within the database itself. Relationships can be intuitively visualized using graph databases, making it useful for heavily inter-connected data.

Graph databases are part of the NoSQL databases created to address the limitations of the existing relational databases. While the graph model explicitly lays out the dependencies between nodes of data, the relational model and other NoSQL database models link the data by implicit connections. Graph databases, by design, allow simple and fast retrieval of complex hierarchical structures that are difficult to model in relational systems. Graph databases are similar to 1970s network model databases in that both represent general graphs, but network-model databases operate at a lower level of abstraction and lack easy traversal over a chain of edges.

GraphQL is a syntax that describes how to ask for data and is generally used to load data from a server to a client. GraphQL has three main characteristics:

It lets the client specify exactly what data it needs.
It makes it easier to aggregate data from multiple sources.
It uses a type system to describe data.





<h1> Implemented </h1>


<strong> Profile: </strong>

The digital version of the personal white board often seen in long term care homes beside each resident’s bed.
<br/> 

<strong> Community:  </strong> 

The community feature addresses the lack of communication (mostly remote communication) among families, caregivers and residents.

  
<strong> Schedule: </strong>

The schedule addresses the concerns and frustrations of families, friends, or caregivers for the lack of information, updates about the dementia resident on a regular basis at the long-term care home.


  
  <h1> Not Implemented </h1>

<strong>Media: </strong> 

The media feature addresses the lack of customized and personalized social media platforms for dementia residents, enabling residents to feel engaged and involved in the daily life of communities, spirit and nature.



<strong> Games:</strong>

The games feature facilitates entertainment and interactive activities for dementia residents. This is also a future development with in-depth research regarding Cognitive, Memory and Exercise games. Content could be chosen to be included/excluded by members.
