<strong> Schedule: </strong>

The schedule addresses the concerns and frustrations of families, friends, or caregivers for the lack of information, updates about the dementia resident on a regular basis at the long-term care home.

<ul>
  <li>
A real-time calendar of resident’s activities updated and managed by authorized members in the circle of care. Digital calendar allows users to view activities daily, weekly or monthly to best suit their preferences. 
  </li>

  <li>

Members in the circle of care can register/edit/remove their own activities with the resident on any certain date and time. All activities with different members are displayed on the calendar, which allows ease of cooperation and communication, while avoiding conflicts around the care of residents. 
  </li>

  <li>

The Schedule feature also allows members to request for help to fill in a certain activity with residents. The member who posts the requests is most likely not able to do the activity for some reason. Requests can be viewed by members in the circle of care (or certain members depending on preference) and be either accepted, declined or expired by the stated date and time.

Reminder notification sent to a member's account is another important aspect of Schedule to remind them to show-up for their own activities.
