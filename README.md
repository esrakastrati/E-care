# E-care


Profile: The digital version of the personal white board often seen in long term care homes beside each resident’s bed.
Resident’s profile includes name, age, location, hobbies, interesting facts, health conditions. Fields are updated and edited by authorized family members/caregivers anytime and anywhere and could be viewed in a real-time manner by all members in the circle of care. (profile image
Community: The community feature addresses the lack of communication (mostly remote communication) among families, caregivers and residents.
Contains contact information of members in the circle of care (name, role/relationship with resident, e-mail, phone number). 
From here, members can contact each other (through message, audio call, or video call). Members can also create group chats/group calls either for the purpose of:
discussing the care for dementia residents
contacting dementia residents remotely if the resident is capable of handling calls himself/herself, or when a member is with the resident at a point in time. 
The feature also allows authorized members to invite, add or remove people from the circle of care. (community image)
Schedule: The schedule addresses the concerns and frustrations of families, friends, or caregivers for the lack of information, updates about the dementia resident on a regular basis at the long-term care home.
A real-time calendar of resident’s activities updated and managed by authorized members in the circle of care. Digital calendar allows users to view activities daily, weekly or monthly to best suit their preferences. 
Members in the circle of care can register/edit/remove their own activities with the resident on any certain date and time. All activities with different members are displayed on the calendar, which allows ease of cooperation and communication, while avoiding conflicts around the care of residents. 
The Schedule feature also allows members to request for help to fill in a certain activity with residents. The member who posts the requests is most likely not able to do the activity for some reason. Requests can be viewed by members in the circle of care (or certain members depending on preference) and be either accepted, declined or expired by the stated date and time.
Reminder notification sent to a member's account is another important aspect of Schedule to remind them to show-up for their own activities.
Media: The media feature addresses the lack of customized and personalized social media platforms for dementia residents, enabling residents to feel engaged and involved in the daily life of communities, spirit and nature.
Today is a feature for members in the circle of care to upload daily short stories in the form of pictures, videos, etc. that could be played automatically from one member to another. Stories are available within 24 hours.
Gallery includes pictures and videos uploaded from members, together with captions, name tags for the content. Users can also create albums with topics and set up a digital frame for the albums. This digital frame acts like a slideshow of pictures and videos with the option of background music/voice audio for a convenient and engaging viewing experience.
Music is the customized list of songs, audios for the residents based on their preferences. This feature is a future development with concerns regarding audio/music providers.
Spiritual is a personalized spiritual/religious space with choices of Scripture, Sermon, Family Prayers or Inspiration content. Content could be chosen to be included/excluded and uploaded by authorized members. 
Nature includes nature-theme (morning, night, rain, forest, waterfall, etc.) videos with built-in nature sound. Content could be chosen to be included/excluded by members.
Games: The games feature facilitates entertainment and interactive activities for dementia residents. This is also a future development with in-depth research regarding Cognitive, Memory and Exercise games. Content could be chosen to be included/excluded by members.
